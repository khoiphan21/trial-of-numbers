# **Luna Academy: The Trial of Numbers â€“ Online Game Requirements**

## **1. Core Game Concept**

**Luna Academy: The Trial of Numbers** is an online multiplayer deduction game where students collaborate to deduce a hidden five-number sequence (0-9). An automated AI-driven tutor validates hints and provides feedback, aiming to help students solve the sequence in as few rounds as possible.

## **2. Game Flow & Rules**

### **2.1 Game Setup**

- A player can create a game lobby without an account.
- A unique **6-character alphanumeric game ID** is generated for each game.
- Other players can join by entering the game ID.
- The game is stored in **Firebase Firestore**, and all clients receive **real-time updates** on game state.
- A minimum of **2 players** is required to start; the maximum number of players per game is **10**.
- The game starts once the host clicks **Start Game**.
- A **random number set** is assigned from the predefined **50 sets** (each containing five unique numbers from 0-9).

### **2.2 Game Rounds**

The game consists of up to **10 rounds**, with players aiming to deduce the sequence in as few rounds as possible.

Each round consists of the following phases:

1. **Submission Phase** (Players)

   - Each player submits **up to 3 Hint Cards**, but only **one per slot (A-E)**.
   - Submissions are sent to the server.
   - If a player does not submit within the time limit (e.g., **60 seconds**), they forfeit their turn for that round.

2. **Hint Processing Phase** (AI Tutor)

   - The **automated tutor AI** processes the submitted Hint Cards.
   - Each hint is either:
     - **Accepted (Correct)** â†’ The hint remains in place.
     - **Flipped (Incorrect)** â†’ The card flips to show it is false (e.g., "Odd" flips to mean "Even").
   - The tutor does **not reorder hints** or **remove hints**.

3. **Deduction & Discussion Phase** (Players)
   - Players discuss the updated hints and adjust their strategies.
   - No new Hint Cards are drawnâ€”players must manage their **fixed 10-card hand**.
   - Players prepare for the next round.

### **2.3 Final Guess & Scoring**

- Players must deduce the correct five-number sequence.
- The game ends when:
  - A player correctly submits the full sequence.
  - The game reaches **10 rounds**.
  - There is only **one player left**, meaning they lose with **0 points**.
- Scoring formula:
  - **Score = 10 - (Number of rounds elapsed)**
  - If a player solves the sequence in **3 rounds**, they earn **7 points**.
  - If a player fails within **10 rounds**, they earn **0 points**.
  - A leaderboard can be maintained for high scores.

## **3. Backend & Database Design**

### **3.1 Firestore Database Structure**

```
/games/{gameID}
    - host: string (host's ID)
    - players: array (list of player IDs)
    - roundNumber: int (current round)
    - numberSet: array (5 unique numbers assigned to slots A-E)
    - hintBoard: array (current active hints per slot)
    - playerSubmissions: object (each playerâ€™s submitted hints)
    - flippedHints: array (flipped hints per slot)
    - gameState: string ('waiting', 'in_progress', 'completed')
```

### **3.2 Real-time Updates**

- **All players** receive real-time updates through Firestore listeners.
- When a player submits a hint, it is recorded and processed automatically.
- The AI tutor's hint verification updates the Firestore database.
- Each playerâ€™s UI updates live with flipped hints and round progression.
